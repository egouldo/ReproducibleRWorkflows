## What is 'dplyr', and why you should use it for data wrangling

Data wrangling is the messy process of cleaning, re-shaping and re-organising data from the raw format you imported into R into another format that allows for some analysis.

dplyr makes wrangling your data frames a breeze. dplyr is a metaphorical set of ‘pliers’ for wrangling your data frames, row- or column-wise subsetting, conduct group-wise operations on multiple subsets of data, or merge data frame and matching rows by value rather than position. 

Everything you can do in dplyr, you can do in base R. So why bother? dplyr is expressive, and verb-focused, rather than object-focused, meaning that common data manipulation problems take less code and less mental effort to write. This means it's easy for your collaborators (including your future-self) to read. This will become more apparent as you become more familiar with using dplyr on your own data. Moreover, much of dplyr’s work is implemented behind the scenes in C++ code, making wrangling larger data frames lightning-fast! 

## Dplyr, a "grammar" of data manipulation

:::columns
:::column
**Learning our verbs and writing sentences:**

- row-wise subsetting: `filter()` takes logical conditions as arguments
- column-wise subsetting: `select()` takes column names or tidyr functions to select matching columns

- Create new variables, change existing variables: `mutate()`
- summarise data with summary statistics: `summarise()`

- Reorder rows: `arrange()`
- Rename variables: `rename()`
:::
::: column
:::fragment
**Dplyr verbs have a common syntax:**

Each of the verbs above follow the same syntax:

- The first argument is a data-frame
- subsequent arguments describe what to do to that data frame, using the variable names (unquoted or 'bare'). Columns are referred by unquoted names, without need to use the `$` operator.
- the function returns a new data frame
- input and output dataframes are *tidy* dataframes for all dplyr verbs (we will get to this in the [next module](./06_tidy_data.Rmd))

Importantly, dplyr functions don't have side-effects, this means that the your data wrangling won't update the object you are working with unless you use the assignment operator `<-` to overwrite that object, or write to a new object.

## **Subsetting Observations (rows)**

Let's subset only the rows where Season is equal to 1. We use the `dplyr::filter()` function. 
- The first argument is the data frame we wish to filter through. 
- The second argument is a logical expression (two or more values separated by the [logical operators](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Logic.html): `==`, `!=`, `&`, `|`, etc., returning a logical, `TRUE` or `FALSE`). Try in console: `?Comparison` or `?base::logic`.

:::{.r-stack}
:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
```{r filter-one-expression, echo=TRUE}
dplyr::filter(.data = bat_dat, Season == 1)
```
:::

:::fragment
You can filter based on multiple variables. Let's get the sites from `Season 1`, and where there were more than 100 recordings of `Chgouldii`. How many sites are there where this was the case?
```{r filter-multiple-expresions, echo = TRUE}
dplyr::filter(.data = bat_dat, Season == 1, Chgouldii > 100)
```
:::
:::

## **Subsetting Observations (rows)**

Here are three other very useful filtering functions:

:::{.r-stack}
:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
1. Remove duplicate rows with `dplyr::distinct()`
```{r distinct, echo = TRUE}
distinct(bat_dat) #no optional args given, uses all variables
distinct(bat_dat, Site) # give a variable as an argument, that var will determine uniqueness
```
:::
:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
2. Select rows by position with `dplyr::slice()`
```{r slice, echo = TRUE}
slice(bat_dat, 23)
slice(bat_dat, c(1:5, 11)) # More than one argument? concatenate
```
:::
:::{.fragment .fade-in}
3. Get the top *n* entries with `dplyr::top_n()`
The second argument is *n*, and the third argument is the variable you wish to use for ordering.
```{r top-n, echo = TRUE}
top_n(bat_dat, 1 , Mmacropus)
```
:::
:::

## **Subsetting Variables (Columns)**

:::{.r-stack}
:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
Let's get only the following columns with `dplyr::select()`: `Site`, `Habitat`, `Season`, `Chgouldii`

```{r selecting, echo=TRUE}
dplyr::select(bat_dat, Site, Habitat, Season, Chgouldii)
```
We can also tell R that we wish it to drop some variables from our data:
```{r de-selecting-vars, echo=TRUE}
dplyr::select(bat_dat, -Humidity)
```
:::
:::{.fragment .fade-in}
As well as using the bare column names to select a variable. We can also use a suite of helper functions to match column names. This is useful when we have many variables we wish to subset by, but want to minimise typing. For the full suite of helper functions, type `?select` in the console. Some important ones are:

- `contains()`
- `ends_with()`
- `starts_with()`
- `matches()`

```{r select-starts-with, echo=TRUE}
select(bat_dat, starts_with("dist")) # not case sensitive unless we tell R so
```
:::
:::

## **Alter existing or create new variables with `mutate()`**

After the first data frame argument, `mutate()` takes one or more name-value pairs.
Which is simply the name of a new or existing variable, followed by an `=` and some expression making computations from existing variables.

- Add new variables:

> You accidentally mistook some morphological variation for a completely different species
> Let's compute the sum of the counts for `Taustralis` and `Vdarlingtoni` species (call `View` for easy )

```{r mutate-new, echo=TRUE}
dplyr::mutate(bat_dat, Taust_Vdarl = Taustralis + Vdarlingtoni)
```

## **Alter existing or create new variables with `mutate()`**

- Change existing ones:

To alter an existing variable we use the name of that variable in the name-value pair argument to `mutate()`, and then provide some computation to that variable on the right.

Imagine there was an error at some point during data collation and a decimal place was shifted, let's pretend it was for the variable `House500`. 

```{r mutate-existing, echo=TRUE}
mutate(bat_dat, House500 = House500 / 10)
```

## **Make new variables summarised from existing variables**

:::columns
:::column
Like mutate `summarise()` also uses name-value pairs of expressions. On the left-hand side is the name of the summary variable you wish to create, on the right hand side of the `=` is an expression that uses a summary function.

Sumary functions take a vector of values and return a single value, such as `mean()` or `sum()`. This can be represented visually by:

```{r summary-fun, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets/dplyr_summary_function.png"))
```
Some key window functions include:

- `first()`
- `last()`
- `min()`
- `max()`
- statistical functions, like `median()`, `sd()`, `var()`. 
:::
:::column
Let's take the mean number of *Chgouldii* observations in 
```{r summarise, echo=TRUE}
summarise(bat_dat, mean_Chgouldii = mean(Chgouldii))
```

> Observe how 188 observations have now been reduced to 1 value. Because the resultant vector is shorter than the input vector, this means we can no longer have a nice, square data frame, consequently, all other variables have been dropped.


:::
:::

## **Renaming variables**

`dplyr::rename()` takes a comma-separated list of unquoted expressions. On the left-hand side of the expression, you provide the new name of the variable, on the right hand side the current column name.

```{r rename,echo=TRUE}
rename(bat_dat, Cg = Chgouldii, Cm = Chmorio)
```

# Writing sentences, joining verbs with pipes `%>%`

So far we've been dealing with individual functions or 'verbs', but what if we want to write sentences so-to-speak? Often we want to combine actions for example, you might want to select and filter at the same time.

let's look at how we would achieve selecting the first five variables in `bat_dat` and then filtering for more than 50 bat observations for both `Chgouldii` and `Chmorio`:

```{r no-pipes,echo=TRUE}
filter(select(bat_dat, 1:5), Chgouldii > 50, Chmorio > 50)
```

It's not very easy on the eye to read through these nested functions. Two sequential functions are difficult enough, imagine chaining more than 2? You could assign the first operation to a temporary object, but as your project matures your workspace can become cluttered with objects, which can be an issue if you have large amounts of data.

And now with pipes:

```{r pipes,echo=TRUE}
select(bat_dat, 1:5) %>%
        filter(Chgouldii > 50, Chmorio > 50)
```

> How to read the code: say 'then' when you encounter the pipe at the end of each line.

## **So what is the pipe?**

The pipe simply passes an object on the left hand side as the first argument of a function on the right hand side. You can use them on any class of object within R, your object doesn't necessarily have to be a data frame. If you wish to pass the object on the left hand side as an argument other than the first. 

We type a `.` in place of the object within the function on the right hand side:

```
x %>% f(y) is the same as f(x,y)
y %>% f(x, ., z) is the same as f(x, y, z)
```

## **Why you should convert to using pipes?**

- More readable code is easier to pick up for future-you and collaborators (no nested-functions): You dont have to read your functions from the inside out, so you can observe the sequence of operations more clearly and with little effort.
- It is therefore easier to pin-point sources of errors! You can debug line-by-line, running each line at a time until you isolate the command that breaks the chain
- Your code is easier to type, flowing from one function to the next, just as your train of thought does 
- You won't miss a closing bracket when you type your code with pipes
- You are less likely to create intermediate objects, so its easier to keep track of which object is the appropriate object to be working with

## Grouped operations: Split, apply, combine operations

The ability to combine the above functionality to perform grouped operations is the real source of power in dplyr. The `dplyr::group_by()` function groups data into rows with the same value of a given variable, such that we can perform some summary or mutate computation for each group. 

The `dplyr::group_by()` function takes one or more unquoted column names as its arguments.

We can represent these two instances visually:

```{r grouped-operations, fig.cap = "grouped operations"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets/dplyr_grouped_operations.png"))
```

With ecological data, you will find that you often want to group by some combination of sampling unit, or other site-based environmental co-variate. You will almost always perform grouped operations on variables that are categorical variables, such as on factors, integer or character vectors, rather than on variables that are continuous, like numeric ones.

## Grouped operations: Split, apply, combine operations

At each site, get the number of *Chgouldii* observations (interested in looking at effect of season)

Does the mean number of *Chgouldii* observations change from one season to the next?

```{r mean-gouldii-by-season,echo=TRUE}
bat_dat %>%
        select(1:4) %>%
        group_by(Season) %>%
        summarise(mean_Cg = mean(Chgouldii))
```

## Grouped operations: Split, apply, combine operations

- Let's `group_by()` both `Season` and `Bioregion` this time. 
- The grouping occurs sequentially, grouping within groups, beginning from the first variable supplied on the left hand side, working towards the right.
- We can supply more than one expression to our summarise function, often when we compute the mean, we also want to compute the standard error of the mean:
```{r more-than-one-group,echo=TRUE}
# Define a standard error function called se:
se <- function(x) {
        sqrt(var(x, na.rm = TRUE) / length(na.omit(x)))
}

# Apply the function to the Chgouldii column
bat_dat %>%
        select(1:4, Bioregion) %>%
        group_by(Bioregion, Season) %>%
        summarise(mean_Cg = mean(Chgouldii),
                  se_Cg = se(Chgouldii))
```

## Grouped operations: Split, apply, combine operations

:::columns
:::column
*Using window functions with `mutate()`*

Just as `summarise()` uses window functions, `mutate()` uses window functions, which are functions that take a vector of values, and return another vector of values, with the output vector being the same length as the input vector. They are most useful when performing operations on groups of data.

```{r fig-window-function, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets/dplyr_window_function.png"))
```

:::
:::column
Some useful window functions include:

- `between()` Are values between a and b?
- `min_rank()` Ranks with ties
- `ntile()` bins vectors into buckets
- `cumsum()` Cumulative sum
- `cummean()` Cumulative mean

## Grouped operations: Split, apply, combine operations

As a trivial example, let's bin the `Chgouldii` obsrevations into 5 equally sized bins:

```{r grouped-mutate-window-function,echo=TRUE}
bat_dat %>%
        select(1:4) %>%
        group_by(Season) %>%
        mutate(bin_Cg = ntile(Chgouldii,n = 5)) %>%
        arrange(Season, bin_Cg)
```

# Challenge 8: Type coercing (7-minutes)

When we imported our bat data earlier, we explicitly coerced some columns to factors but not all of the categorical variables that needed to be converted.

1. Within your script `01_tidy_data.R`, convert the following columns to factors using the `mutate()` function:
- Moon
- NatEx
- Bioregion  

> Hint: you can coerce integer variables to factor using `as.factor()` from base R.
> Tip: You can experiment in the console as you go to see if your code works
> Tip: In RStudio, with the cursor inside your mutate function, you can hit 'tab' to bring up a list of variables within your data frame (purple tags), use the arrow keys to find the variable you are looking for and hit enter to paste the variable name into your code. You can type the first one or two letters of the variable name to narrow down the list before hitting tab.

```{r}
#| label: convert cols-to-fac
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| code-summary: "Answer"
bat_dat <- 
        bat_dat %>%
        mutate(Moon = as.factor(Moon),
               NatEx = as.factor(NatEx),
               Bioregion = as.factor(Bioregion))
```
2. Don't forget that dplyr functions don't have side effects, so you need to assign this to the `bat_dat` variable inside your script.
3. Save your script, commit, push to GitHub.
4. Source your script to update `bat_dat` in your workspace

# Challenge 9: Fixing errors, replacing values (7-minute)

Your colleague has spotted a typo in one of the `Site` names. It should be `"Ferny Creek"` not `"Ferny Crrek"`.
1. Fix this mistake using `mutate()` and `replace()` (though you could use an `ifelse()` statement if you are confident)
Hint, provide the following arguments to replace in this order:

- The unquoted variable name you wish to replace values within
-  A logical expression of what to look for with the column name on the RHS, and the incorrect value as a character string on the RHS
-  A character string value containing the replacement site name.
```{r}
#| label: replcae-spp
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| code-summary: "Answer"
# Either
bat_dat <- bat_dat %>% 
        mutate(Site = replace(Site, Site == "Ferny Crrek", "Ferny Creek"))
# Or
bat_dat <- bat_dat %>% 
        mutate(Site = ifelse(Site == "Ferny Crrek", "Ferny Creek", Site))

```

2. instead of re-assigning this to the `bat_dat` object separately, chain it onto your code from the previous challenge using the `%>%` operator.
3. Save, commit, push to GitHub
4. Source your script to update `bat_dat` in your workspace
